#+TITLE: From "Research in Computer Science" course

  During my Masters' I attended Claudio Gutierrez' wonderful "Research
  in Computer Science" course [[https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~cgutierr/cursos/INV/][(In Spanish)]] by Claudio Guiterrez.  All
  of the readings from that course are useful, and I'll try to provide
  english pointers here where available.
